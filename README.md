# Blockchain-Based-Decentralized-Transaction-In-Banking-Sector-


This project presents a blockchain-based decentralized transaction settlement system designed to enhance security, transparency, and trust in digital transactions. Traditional centralized systems often face challenges such as single points of failure, delays, and lack of transparency. By leveraging blockchain technology, this system eliminates the need for intermediaries, ensuring peer-to-peer transactions with immutable records. Each transaction is secured using cryptographic hashing (SHA-256) and grouped into blocks that are validated through a consensus mechanism, simulating proof-of-work. A unique login mechanism is incorporated to enhance user authentication using a dynamically generated keypad and verification number. The system ensures that data integrity and traceability are maintained throughout the transaction process. Built using Java and integrated with a SQL database, it supports efficient data storage and retrieval. This solution aims to provide a secure and tamper-proof environment for digital settlements, making it suitable for applications in finance, supply chain, and secure identity verification systems.


## Goals and Objective
•	 Develop a decentralized transaction settlement platform using blockchain technology.
•	Eliminate dependency on centralized intermediaries like banks or third-party services.
•	Ensure secure, peer-to-peer fund transfers through smart contracts.
•	Enhance transparency, immutability, and trust in the transaction process.
•	Design and deploy smart contracts in Solidity to manage contributors, vendors, and campaigns.
•	Use the Ethereum test network and MetaMask for secure and seamless transaction interactions.
•	Build a user-friendly web interface for initiating, validating, and tracking transactions.
•	Store and handle data securely using mappings and contract-level access control.
•	Automate fund release based on predefined conditions (e.g., contribution goals, deadlines).
•	Maintain a transparent and auditable ledger of all transactions on the blockchain.
•	Perform testing and debugging to ensure reliability, accuracy, and security of the system.
•	Document all system components, workflows, and user guidelines for future scalability and maintenance.



### Application
Real-Time Cross-Border Payments: It settles international transactions within seconds. It reduces reliance on SWIFT and correspondent banks,
•	Clearing and Settlement of Securities: Automates post- trade processes like clearing, settlement, reconciliation. It reduces risk and processing time in stock/bond markets.
•	Smart Contracts for Automated Settlements: Helps trigger settlement once conditions are met. Reduces the need for manual intervention or third party
